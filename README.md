# Data-Visualization-
US National Parks data (1979-2023)


This was done as part of the project requirement for the course PUBH 7461 Exploring and Visualizing data with R at the University Of Minnesota.

The main goal was to come up with intriguing questions and try to answer them through visualizations or tables,especially using the ggplot2 and gt packages in R. Additionally, the output expected was in slidy format and in the form of slides. This work meets all those requirements and is in R Markdown format.
